## Hosting on LAN

To make the application accessible on your local network:

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - On Windows: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`
   - On macOS/Linux: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig` or `ip addr show`

2. Start the server as described in the Usage section.

3. On other devices in the same network, open a web browser and go to `http://<your-ip-address>:3000`
   Replace `<your-ip-address>` with the IP address you found in step 1.

Note: Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections on port 3000, or change the port in `server.js` if needed.
